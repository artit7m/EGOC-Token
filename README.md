A Decentralized Storage and 5G Wireless Network leveraging AI technology



Digital data security is a growing concern for individuals and companies alike. With digital data expected to increase by 120% by 2026, the need for secure, reliable, and scalable solutions is paramount. However, centralized cloud services are often expensive, vulnerable to attacks, and prone to data breaches and unauthorized data sharing.

To address these challenges, we are proposing a decentralized system that leverages blockchain technology and 5G devices. Our solution will involve creating micro servers spread across the world, where individuals can purchase 5G devices to store data in an encrypted way, ensuring improved security, privacy, and fair pricing.

Our decentralized system will solve two major problems. Firstly, we will provide a better blockchain solution using different consensus mechanisms that will have no transaction fees, no fees for deploying smart contracts, and AI-generated codes for smart contracts with machine learning as a software supervisor. Secondly, we will create decentralized storage that will improve security, speed, scalability, and fast data recovery and signatures.

Our approach involves incentivizing miners with new coins when they create new blocks and higher staking rates. Additionally, we will charge users a 5% fee for buying and selling our coin, with three percent of the fees going towards decentralized liquidations and two percent going to the stakers/holders.

For decentralized storage, we will reward nodes with new blocks based on the coverage they provide and the traffic of the data they transport and store. We will also leverage 5G internet for bandwidth, which will solve speed issues.

To ensure easy adoption and scaling, we will create a hardware device that will help individuals connect to the ecosystem easily. With a decentralized system, we can easily scale and create updates through voting, utilizing a close system of nodes and a DAO voting process. Members of the DAO will need to have staked EGO coins and passed a knowledge test about the particular thing we want to change.

Our decentralized system is designed to be more secure, less expensive, and more equitable than centralized cloud services. We believe that our solution will create a better ecosystem, privacy, digital signatures using blockchain, and much more.
